**Mock Exam: Data Visualization with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**

*Instructions:*

- Complete the following tasks using Jupyter Notebook.
- Use the provided datasets or download them from the given sources.
- Show all your code and output for each question.
- Ensure that your visualizations are well-labeled and include titles, axis labels, and legends where appropriate.

---

**Datasets:**

1. **Titanic Dataset:** Available in Seaborn's built-in datasets.
   - Load using: `titanic = sns.load_dataset('titanic')`

2. **Diabetes Dataset:** Available from Kaggle.
   - Download from: [Diabetes Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set)

### **Question 1: Missing Data Visualization**

a) Using the Titanic dataset, create a heatmap to visualize the locations of missing data.

b) Which columns have the most missing data?

---

### **Question 2: Violin Plot**

a) Using the Diabetes dataset, create a violin plot to compare the distribution of `Glucose` levels between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

b) What does the violin plot tell you about the `Glucose` levels in relation to diabetes?
